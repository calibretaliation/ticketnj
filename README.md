## Usage

1. Open the app in a web browser
2. Choose your preferred color from the selection screen
3. The slideshow will start with the images corresponding to your chosen color
4. Use the "Back to Colors" button to return and select a different color

## Adding New Colors (GitHub Pages Compatible)

The app now automatically detects colors using a pure client-side solution! To add new colors:

### Method 1: Automatic (Recommended for GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new folder in the `colors/` directory with your color name
2. Add `image1.png` and `image2.png` to that folder
3. Commit and push to GitHub
4. GitHub Actions will automatically update `colors/index.txt`
5. The website will automatically detect and display your new color!

### Method 2: Manual Index Update
1. Create a new folder in the `colors/` directory with your color name
2. Add `image1.png` and `image2.png` to that folder
3. Add the color name to `colors/index.txt`
4. Push changes to GitHub Pages

### How It Works

#### Client-Side Color Detection
- **Primary Method**: Reads from `colors/index.txt` for efficient loading
- **Fallback Method**: Scans predefined color names by testing image URLs
- **GitHub Actions**: Automatically maintains `colors/index.txt` when folders change
- **Smart Colors**: Known colors get predefined styles, unknown colors get auto-generated colors

#### GitHub Actions Integration
- Monitors changes to the `colors/` folder
- Automatically updates `colors/index.txt` when folders are added/removed
- Only includes folders that contain both `image1.png` and `image2.png`
- Sorts color names alphabetically

## Technical Details

- **Slideshow Interval**: 0.5 seconds between image transitions
- **Countdown Duration**: 25 minutes from slideshow start
- **PWA Ready**: Includes manifest.json for installation on mobile devices
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices
- **GitHub Pages Compatible**: Pure client-side color detection
- **No Server Required**: Works entirely in the browser
- **Auto-Discovery**: Automatically finds and loads available colors
